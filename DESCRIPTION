Description: Sample code to generate the marginal posterior densities for the inference of theta=(sigma,mu,C) from
    the 6-dimensional JR-NMM (a Hamiltonian type SDE). The proposed algorithm is based on the combination of the 
    structure-preserving numerical Strang splitting scheme and the estimated invariant densities and invariant spectral
    densities as proposed summary statistics. The chosen distance is a weighted sum of the areas between these curves and
    the corresponding curves estimated from the observed dataset. We refer to the paper on
